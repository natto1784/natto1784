# Hello

- Your average 18 year old, nothing special there
- Struggling to code (for real)
- I know a lot of stuff but am hardly good at anything particular
- Interested in a lot of things for sure but can't keep up with the peers when it comes to stuff I already know
- So yeah I'm trying to improve at basically everything
- Huge experience and knowledge difference between me and my peers; Gonna make up for it by working hard
- But I know I shall reach there someday, maybe not in the immediate future but I'm trying my best
- Fun fact: I suck right now but I know for sure someday I won't :)

### Things currently trying to learn/improve
- Functional Programming
- C
- Rust
- Assembly and Processors in general
- Some OOP
- Some basic technologies I should have been familiar with ages ago

### Things I wanna learn/understand in the near future
- Golang
- Basic server management (I don't have resources for managing one right now even if I want to)
- Linux Kernel
- Cryptography (maybe?)
- Stocks and markets

~~This was one huge intro~~
